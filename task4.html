<h1>Camelids</h1>
<p><strong>"The four llamas and two camels are camelids tend to be large and are strictly
herbivorous. Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways. They have a three-
chambered rather than a four-chambered digestive tract; an upper lip that is split in
two with each part separately mobile; and an isolated incisor in the upper jaw. They
have long legs that, because they lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body,
look longer still. (from Wikipedia)".</strong></p>
